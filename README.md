Tagging is slow - do the vast majority of the writing in a separate document (with all your usual presets) before copying over for finishing touches.

Official list of packages compatible with tagging: https://latex3.github.io/tagging-project/tagging-status/
The list is pessimistic - some packages labeled as incompatible have workarounds or cause only less-than-ideal tagging.

For Tikz, look in the closed issues for workaround.

The template has only been tested with MikTeX. It probably works with an up-to-date version of TeXLive.\
I suspect it won't work with Overleaf (packages too out of date and compilation timeout) - but this has not been tested.
